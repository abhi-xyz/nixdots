* Features

** Flakes
- Utilizes Nix Flakes for precise dependency management, ensuring consistent environments across installations.

** Home Manager
- Configures user-specific software, allowing for personalized settings and applications tailored to my workflow.

** SOPS-nix
- Employs SOPS for managing secrets at both root and user levels, ensuring sensitive information is securely stored and accessed.

* Warning

- I do not recommend installing this configuration as-is or using any other Nix configuration directly from repositories. Doing so may lead to a sense of incompleteness and confusion about your system's setup.

- If you're a beginner, take some time to study this and other people's configuration files. Implement changes and features on your own to gain a deeper understanding of how NixOS works. This hands-on approach will help you build a more meaningful and personalized setup.
