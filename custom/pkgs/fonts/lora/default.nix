      Lora is a well-balanced contemporary serif with roots in calligraphy. 
      It is a text typeface with moderate contrast, well-suited for body text. 
      A paragraph set in Lora will make a memorable appearance because of its 
      brushed curves in contrast with driving serifs. 
      The overall typographic voice of Lora perfectly conveys the mood of a 
      modern-day story or an art essay.
